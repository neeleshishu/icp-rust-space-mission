# Space Exploration Simulation

## Description
A space exploration simulation application that allows users to plan and execute space missions, learn about celestial bodies, and contribute to citizen science projects related to space exploration.

## Data Structure

### SpaceMission
- `id`: Unique identifier for the space mission.
- `mission_name`: Name of the space mission.
- `destination`: Destination of the mission.
- `launch_date`: Timestamp for the launch date.
- `estimated_arrival_date`: Timestamp for the estimated arrival date.
- `description`: Description of the space mission.

## Rust Code

### Dependencies
- [`ic_cdk`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-cdk): DFINITY Candid development kit.
- [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde): Serialization/deserialization framework.
- [`ic_stable_structures`](https://github.com/dfinity/stable): Stable memory structures for DFINITY canisters.

### Implementation

1. **Create a Space Mission**
   - Use `add_space_mission` to add a new space mission.
     ```rust
     let payload = SpaceMissionPayload {
         mission_name: "Apollo 11".to_string(),
         destination: "Moon".to_string(),
         launch_date: timestamp(),
         estimated_arrival_date: timestamp() + 86400 * 7, // 7 days later
         description: "First manned mission to the Moon.".to_string(),
         // Add more fields as needed
     };
     let new_mission = add_space_mission(payload).expect("Failed to add space mission.");
     ```

2. **Retrieve a Space Mission**
   - Use `get_space_mission` to retrieve details of a specific space mission.
     ```rust
     let mission_id = new_mission.id;
     let retrieved_mission = get_space_mission(mission_id).expect("Space mission not found.");
     ```

3. **Update a Space Mission**
   - Use `update_space_mission` to update details of an existing space mission.
     ```rust
     let payload = SpaceMissionPayload {
         mission_name: "Apollo 11 Updated".to_string(),
         destination: "Moon".to_string(),
         launch_date: timestamp(),
         estimated_arrival_date: timestamp() + 86400 * 10, // Updated estimated arrival date
         description: "First manned mission to the Moon.".to_string(),
         // Add more fields as needed
     };
     let updated_mission = update_space_mission(mission_id, payload).expect("Failed to update space mission.");
     ```

4. **Delete a Space Mission**
   - Use `delete_space_mission` to delete a space mission.
     ```rust
     let deleted_mission = delete_space_mission(mission_id).expect("Failed to delete space mission.");
     ```

5. **Retrieve All Space Missions**
   - Use `get_all_space_missions` to retrieve details of all space missions.
     ```rust
     let all_missions = get_all_space_missions();
     ```

6. **Retrieve Space Missions Before a Date**
   - Use `get_space_missions_before_date` to retrieve space missions that are estimated to arrive before a specific date.
     ```rust
     let target_date = timestamp() + 86400 * 30; // 30 days later
     let missions_before_date = get_space_missions_before_date(target_date);
     ```

7. **Update Estimated Arrival Date**
   - Use `update_estimated_arrival_date` to update the estimated arrival date of a space mission.
     ```rust
     let new_estimated_arrival_date = timestamp() + 86400 * 15; // Updated estimated arrival date
     let mission_with_updated_date = update_estimated_arrival_date(mission_id, new_estimated_arrival_date).expect("Failed to update estimated arrival date.");
     ```

8. **Retrieve Total Space Missions**
   - Use `get_total_space_missions` to get the total number of space missions.
     ```rust
     let total_missions = get_total_space_missions();
     ```

9. **Retrieve Space Missions Count Before a Date**
   - Use `get_space_missions_count_before_date` to get the count of space missions estimated to arrive before a specific date.
     ```rust
     let missions_count_before_date = get_space_missions_count_before_date(target_date);
     ```

## Notes
- Make sure to customize the payload fields and additional functionalities based on your specific requirements.
- Adjust the timestamps and date calculations according to the desired timeline.
